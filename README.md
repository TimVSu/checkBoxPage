# checkBoxPage

simple next.js page with a couple of checkboxes. Meant to show next.js skills.

## Technologies used

- typescript 
- HTML
- tailwindCSS
- next.js

## How to run 

- run "npm install"
- run "npm run dev"
- the port can be changed by changing "dev" to -p [port] in the "scripts" section of the package.json
- run "npm run build" to create production build
- once a production build has been created it can be started using "npm run start"

## Color theme

- I based the color theme on the crossbuilders webpage. The Theme can be changed by editing the colors in the theme section of tailwind.config.js (The color names have to remain the same).
  
## Responsivness

- responsiveness has been implemented and tested for all devices that are available in the chromium dev tools except the galaxy folds outside screen

## Project status

The project is finished since all task requirements have been met.
