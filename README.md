# checkBoxPage

simple next.js page with a couple of checkboxes. Meant to show next.js skills.

## Technologies used

- typescript 
- HTML
- tailwindCSS
- next.js

## How to run 

- run "npm install"

- the port can be changed by changing "dev" to -p [port] in the "scripts" section of the package.json
- run "npm run build" to create production build
- once a production build has been created it can be started using "npm run start"

## Color theme

- I exclusively used colors from the theme in tailwind.config.ts those colors can be changed to change the theme for the app (color names have to remain)

## Responsivness

- responsiveness has been implemented and tested for alldevices that are available in the chromium dev tools except the galaxy folds outside screen
